# Bombadier - a 3D Tower Defense Game in GameMaker Studio 2.3

Individual tutorials are fun, but developing a game from start to finish is also fun. Here's a series that's exactly that!

The video playlist can be found here:

## Releases

If you're following the series, I'm creating a release each week so that the state of the project at the end of a video can be marked. Each release has two numbers - a major and a minor version number - with each week being the minor version number. This means that the Week 1 project will be 0.1, Week 5 will be 0.5, Week 12 will be 0.12, etc.

The game recieves a "1.0" release upon completion.

The finished product can be found on itch.io [here](https://dragonite.itch.io/bombadier).

## Building

This project was built using **GameMaker Studio 2.3.7.** Later stable releases of 2.x should work.

## Credits

I'm aiming to write this mostly from scratch, but to save time a few native GML extensions are used, plus a bunch of other assets.
